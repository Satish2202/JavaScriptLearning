/*
A function is the building block for a programming language.
Object is an instance of a function

Function Naming convention -
-Function names must start with a letter, underscore, or a dollar sign.
-After the first letter/underscore/dollar, we can use numbers.
-Function names in JavaScripts are case sensitives.
-The code of the function will come inside curly brackets.

How to define function:
function functionName(var1,var2,varn){
 write main block of code here.
    return Expression whose value is output;

Rules to create functions in JavaScript:
All the functions in JavaScript should start with a function keyword.
Function names should be unique.
Parameters passed to function should be comma-separated.

Advantages of Functions:
-Reusability of Code: We can call the function as many times we need in the script,
using this way, it saves the coding efforts.
-Ease of Maintainability: Since we are keeping reusable code in the functions and 
calling those functions when it is required, it will be easy to debug and maintain the code.
