/*
-JavaScript is the synchronous and single-threaded programming language.
-That is to say, only one task can perform at any point in time. But on the contrary, JavaScript also provides the ability to make it behave like an asynchronous language with the help of promises mechanisms.  
Async and Await concept, which introduced in ES 2017, is an advanced way of handling “Promises in JavaScript.”
