/*
A callback, as the name suggests, is a function that is to execute after another function has finished executing. 
As we know, in JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this, functions can take functions as arguments, and 
other functions can also return it. 
Functions that take the additional function as a parameter are called higher-order functions, and
the function which passes as an argument is called a callback function.
